    Q. Edit Distance | (DP-33)

    Practice : https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/

    Given two strings word1 and word2, return the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 to word2.

    You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

    Insert a character
    Delete a character
    Replace a character

    Example 1:

    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    rose -> ros (remove 'e')

    Example 2:

    Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation:
    intention -> inention (remove 't')
    inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
    enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
    exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
    exection -> execution (insert 'u')

    approach->

    To summarise, these are the three choices we have in case characters donâ€™t match:
1. return 1+f(i-1,j) // Insertion of character.
2. return 1+f(i,j-1) // Deletion of character.
3. return 1+f(i-1,j-1) // Replacement of character.
Step 4.  Return the minimum of all choices.
As we have to return the minimum number of operations, we will return the minimum of all operations.

Base Cases:
We are reducing i and j in our recursive relation, there can be two possibilities, either i becomes -1 or j becomes -1., i,e we exhaust either S1 or S2 respectively.
