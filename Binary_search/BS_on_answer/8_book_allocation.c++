/*
 * Allocate Minimum Number of Pages
   Problem Statement: Given an array of integers A of size N and an integer B.

   The College library has N bags, the ith book has A[i] number of pages.

   You have to allocate books to B number of students so that the maximum number of pages allocated to a student is minimum.

   Conditions given :

   A book will be allocated to exactly one student.

   Each student has to be allocated at least one book.

   Allotment should be in contiguous order, for example, A student cannot be allocated book 1 and book 3, skipping book 2.

   Calculate and return the minimum possible number. Return -1 if a valid assignment is not possible.
   Examples:

   Example 1:

   Input: A = [12, 34, 67, 90]
          B = 2
   Output: 113
   Explaination: Letâ€™s see all possible cases of how books can be allocated for each student.
   So, the maximum number of pages allocated in each case is [191,157,113]. So, the minimum number among them is 113. Hence, our result is 113.
