/*
 * Aggressive Cows : Detailed Solution
   Problem Statement: There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

   Examples:

   Input: No of stalls = 5
          Array: {1,2,8,4,9}
          And number of cows: 3

   Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
